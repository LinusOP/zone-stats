# RPUK Zone Stats

# Deprecated
Due to the Roleplay UK Arma 3 Server shutting down, there is no more data to request from the API. Therefore the repository will be Archived, the site will still be live for now, but it will not be displaying any data.

## What is this?
This website fetches data about the capture zones from [Roleplay UK](https://roleplay.co.uk) and displays it in a nice fashion. You can find it here: <https://zonestats.nomad.lol>.

*The website uses information fetched from the Roleplay UK API, it is however not an official website and is not made nor maintained by Roleplay UK.*

## Can I use the code?
Yes, this project is licensed under the [MIT License](./LICENSE). See below for instruction on how to set up the code after cloning the repo.

## How did you make this?
This project was made using the [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) framework, to make it actually look good I use the [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/) component library.
I also use [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/) for some nice looking dates and times.
